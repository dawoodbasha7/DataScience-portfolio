1. Univariate Analysis

    1.1 Numerical columns
        * I have checked mean/median values of numerical columns for stroke = 1/0. Plus plot these descriptive stats of individual compasion of groups.
            Based on the results, we will test hypothesis to check f the diffrence between the groups of each column is really difference.
        * Distributions of the numerical columns (later based on these results type of test is picked in hypothesis test)
        * outlier/anamoly detection. Use specific method using the results of distributions.
            IQR - Not normal (doesnt work on missing data)
            Z-scores - Normal

    1.2 Categorical columns
        * Counter plots of each categorical column


2. Bivariate Analysis

    2.1 NUmerical columns
        * VIF, multicollinearity


3. Statustical INferences

    3.1 Hypothesis 1: 
            Null Hypothesis (H₀):
                            The distribution of BMI is the same for individuals with and without stroke.
                            → There is no statistically significant difference in BMI between the two groups.

            Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):
                            The distribution of BMI is different for individuals with and without stroke.
                            → There is a statistically significant difference in BMI between the two groups.



    3.2 Hypothesis 2:
