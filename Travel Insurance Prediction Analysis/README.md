# Travel Insurance Prediction Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes and fit various ML models to predict and analyse the performances of each model with EDA and statistical inferences.

## Dataset

The analysis utilizes a Kaggle dataset containing information about Travel Insurance Prediction

Dataset Source: [Kaggle - Travel Insurance Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tejashvi14/travel-insurance-prediction-data)

## Tools and Technologies

**Python**: Core programming language for data manipulation and visualization.
**Pandas**: Efficient data manipulation and analysis.
**NumPy**: Mathematical computations for data analysis.
**opendatasets**: To downloading datasets from online sources like Kaggle using API.
**Matplotlib** & **Seaborn**: High-quality visualizations.
**Scikit-learn**: Clustering and advanced data processing.
**Scipy**: For scientific computing.
**Seaborn**: statistical data visualization.
**statsmodels**: For statistical modeling and performing advanced statistical tests.
**Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive environment for analysis and documentation.


## File Structure
